# TBRP_Project

Code Louisville Javascript Spring/Summer 2021

For my Project, I have a collection of books in a To Be Read pile. Existing books are stored in a JSON file and loaded automatically when the user loads the page.  

The user will be able to search for a book and see if it is in the pile already or if they would like to add it.

If it is not in the pile, the user can retrieve info about the book from an API (Google Books).

The user can add the book to the TBR pile, which will appear graphically, or visit a link to buy the book. 

The user can click on a book in the pile and view book information, including how long it has been since the book was added to the TBR pile.

The user can mark books as Read and filter them out from the TBR pile.


Features List:

* Retrieve data from an external API and display data in your app (such as with fetch() or with AJAX

* Read and parse an external file (such as JSON or CSV) into your application and display some data from that in your app

* Create an array, dictionary or list, populate it with multiple values, retrieve at least one value, and use or display it in your application

* Create and use a function that accepts two or more values (parameters), calculates or determines a new value based on those inputs, and returns a new value

* Calculate and display data based on an external factor (ex: get the current date, and display how many days remaining until some event)

* Create a web server with at least one route and connect to it from your application using ExpressJS
