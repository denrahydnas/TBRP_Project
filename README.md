# TBRP_Project

Code Louisville Javascript Spring/Summer 2021

Recently, I noticed that my TBR pile has been growing. Either I'm working on other projects or have gotten new books to distract me, so quite a few have remained in the pile for some time. This gave me the idea to make a TBR app to track all of my To-Be-Read books and how long I've left them languishing in the stack - hopefully prompting me to start reading them sooner. 

For my Project, I created an app that can retrieve information about books and store them in a To Be Read stack on the page. Existing books are stored in a JSON file and populated automatically when the page loads. 

The user will be able to search for a book and get information about it from the Google Books API, to decide if they would like to read it.

The user can add the book to the TBR pile, which will appear as a div in the stack, and/or visit a link to buy the book. 

The user can click on a book in the stack and view the book information, including how long it has been since the book was added to the TBR pile. 

The user can also remove books from the stack entirely. 


To dos: 
 - The user can mark books as Read and filter them out from the TBR pile.
 - Check to see if searched item is in the pile already before getting google books info
