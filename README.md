# TBRP_Project
Code Louisville Javascript Spring/Summer 2021

For my Project, I am going to make a collection of books in a To Be Read pile. 

The user will be able to search for a book and see if it is in the pile already or if they would like to add it.

If it is not in the pile, the user can retrieve info about the book from an API (Google Books or something similar)

The user can add the book to the TBR pile, which will appear graphically. 

The user can track how long it has been since the book was added to the TBR pile

The user can mark books as Read and as In Progress and filter them out from the TBR pile.

-- reach goals: 
drag and drop books in "pile" to re-order them

rate and/or review books marked as read


Project requirements:

* Your application must have a responsive design through the use of media queries, Bootstrap, CSS Grid, Flexbox, and/or other similar approaches - we need to ensure that you can integrate your new JavaScript skills with your HTML/CSS skills you previously learned
We will test your site on at least two different screen sizes (mobile and desktop) and must see that you’ve incorporate some element of responsive design to it
* Project is uploaded to your GitHub repository and shows at minimum 5 separate commits
Using GitHub’s file uploader does not count as a check-in. You must upload via Git
* Project includes a README file that explains the following:
A one paragraph or longer description of what your project is
Which 3+ features you have included from the below lists to meet the requirements
Any special instructions required for the reviewer to run your project
Choose at least 3 items on the Features List below and implement them in your project
We recommend you pick a 4th item (or more!) to add, just in case something goes wrong with one of your other items - 3 is only the minimum requirement


Features List:

* Retrieve data from an external API and display data in your app (such as with fetch() or with AJAX)

** Create a form and save the values (on click of Submit button) to an external file 
You must show us or document where that information is being stored so we can confirm that it’s being saved/persisted

* Create an array, dictionary or list, populate it with multiple values, retrieve at least one value, and use or display it in your application

* Create and use a function that accepts two or more values (parameters), calculates or determines a new value based on those inputs, and returns a new value

** Calculate and display data based on an external factor (ex: get the current date, and display how many days remaining until some event)

** Implement a drag-and-drop interface that allows the user to move elements or items on the page around (reference). For example, drag a file or image into the app from your desktop and have it display. 

* Create a web server with at least one route and connect to it from your application using ExpressJS**



Additional Features you can include but may not be covered by Treehouse:
Post to an external API and show that it has saved/persisted
Read and parse an external file (such as JSON or CSV) into your application and display some data from that in your app
Analyze text and display information about it (ex: how many words in a paragraph)
Visualize data in a graph, chart, or other visual representation of data
Implement a log that records errors, invalid inputs, or other important events and writes them to a text file
Implement a regular expression (regex) to ensure a field either a phone number or an email address is always stored and displayed in the same format
Create 3 or more unit tests for your application (and document how to run them)
Build a conversion tool that converts user input to another type and displays it (ex: converts cups to grams)
** Implement a drag-and-drop interface that allows the user to move elements or items on the page around (reference). For example, drag a file or image into the app from your desktop and have it display. 
Develop your project using a common JavaScript framework such as React, Angular, Vue, etc.
** Create a web server with at least one route and connect to it from your application using ExpressJS**
