# TBRP_Project
Code Louisville Javascript Spring/Summer 2021

For my Project, I have a collection of books in a To Be Read pile, which is stored and loaded automatically when the user navigates to the page.  

The user will be able to search for a book and see if it is in the pile already or if they would like to add it.

If it is not in the pile, the user can retrieve info about the book from an API (Google Books)

The user can add the book to the TBR pile, which will appear graphically. 

The user can click on a book in the pile and view book information, including how long it has been since the book was added to the TBR pile

The user can mark books as Read and as In Progress and filter them out from the TBR pile.


Features List:

* Retrieve data from an external API and display data in your app (such as with fetch() or with AJAX)

* Read and parse an external file (such as JSON or CSV) into your application and display some data from that in your app

* Create an array, dictionary or list, populate it with multiple values, retrieve at least one value, and use or display it in your application

* Create and use a function that accepts two or more values (parameters), calculates or determines a new value based on those inputs, and returns a new value

** Calculate and display data based on an external factor (ex: get the current date, and display how many days remaining until some event)

* Create a web server with at least one route and connect to it from your application using ExpressJS**





Additional Features you can include but may not be covered by Treehouse:
Post to an external API and show that it has saved/persisted
Create a form and save the values (on click of Submit button) to an external file 
You must show us or document where that information is being stored so we can confirm that itâ€™s being saved/persisted
Analyze text and display information about it (ex: how many words in a paragraph)
Visualize data in a graph, chart, or other visual representation of data
Implement a log that records errors, invalid inputs, or other important events and writes them to a text file
Implement a regular expression (regex) to ensure a field either a phone number or an email address is always stored and displayed in the same format
Create 3 or more unit tests for your application (and document how to run them)
Build a conversion tool that converts user input to another type and displays it (ex: converts cups to grams)
** Implement a drag-and-drop interface that allows the user to move elements or items on the page around (reference). For example, drag a file or image into the app from your desktop and have it display. 
Develop your project using a common JavaScript framework such as React, Angular, Vue, etc.
